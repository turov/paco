    <h3>How often should you change kitty litter?</h3>
    <p>If you have a cat, knowing how to care for it is important. One of the important aspects is the timely replacement of the litter in the tray. Knowing how often to change the cat litter is necessary to prevent the appearance of unpleasant odors in the tray. Cats are very sensitive to smells, and if the tray is dirty, they can refuse to use it.</p>
    <h3>How often should you replace cat litter and why</h3>
    <p>By maintaining the tray clean, you will avoid unpleasant situations associated with smells. If cats do not like the smell of dirty trays, they will look for other places to do their business. It can be the corners of a carpet or even a basket with clean linen. Remember that cats have a smell 14 times better than ours, so what looks like a clean cat tray for us, may be unacceptable for them.</p>
    <p>Although automatic litter boxes are becoming more and more popular, their cost can be too high. Therefore, many cat owners continue to use ordinary trays. And by the way, many cats also prefer them.</p>
    <p>The choice of a tray and litter for a cat toilet is an individual preference for your pets, so do not adhere to strict rules and choose what they like. After all, the main thing is their comfort and satisfaction. If your cats do not like trays and accessories, you will quickly notice it.</p>
    <p>Remember that the use of a tray without any litter is not always the best solution, as this can lead to the appearance of unpleasant odors and the need for frequent cleaning of both the tray and the pet itself.</p>

    <h3>How often to change cat litter</h3>
    <p>The pet stores present a wide selection of cat litters made of different materials, each of which has its own unique properties. The frequency of cleaning the cat toilet depends on the type of litter you use.</p>
    <p>The absorbent litter for a cat toilet should be changed 1-2 times a day, removing solid waste after each use.</p>
    <p>How often to change clumping litter is also important to know. Any clumping filler requires a complete replacement once a week, and solid lumps should be removed as soon as they form.</p>
    <p>The silica-gel litter needs to be completely replaced every 2-3 weeks, and solid waste should be removed immediately after the appearance.</p>
    <p>We recommend a weekly deep cleaning of the cat tray using a specialized enzyme substance. Undoubtedly, there is a temptation to abandon weekly cleaning in favor of daily removal from the filler of wet areas. However, this approach does not work with all types of filler.</p>



    <h3>How often do you change cat litter</h3>
    <p>How often to change kitty litter also depends on the quality of daily care for it. If you clean the tray at least twice a day and replace part of the litter weekly, you can carry out thorough cleaning every 2-3 weeks. If you prefer not to remove it every week, you can visually check the state of the filler: if it is dry and does not have any strange smell, cleaning can be postponed. The appearance of even a slight odor is a clear sign that it is time to replace the litter. If your cat begins to avoid the tray, the solution may be a more thorough cleaning.</p>
    <p>If you are not obsessed with cleanliness, it may be worth to do a deep cleaning of the kitty tray only once a year. In this case, the smells are gradually absorbed into the porous surface of the tray, especially if there are scratches on it.</p>

    <h3>How to maintain a cat tray</h3>
    <p>When filling the cat tray, it is important to consider several key points. If you have a regular tray, start by determining the optimal amount of litter. Cats have a sharp sense of smell, and if the litter has an unpleasant odor, they can refuse to use it. To avoid this, it is necessary to regularly clean the box of the remains of poo and dried lumps. This will prevent the appearance of unpleasant odors and preserve cleanliness in the house.</p>
    <p>When choosing a litter, you should pay attention to specialized products for cat trays. They effectively remove mess and unpleasant odors without their adding their own smell, which will not scare away your pet. Pour the litter to a depth of about 0.8 inches, ensuring the effective elimination of unpleasant odors and protecting the surrounding space from the spread of its particles. It also makes the use of the tray more comfortable for your cat since its paws do not get stuck and do not slip in the litter.</p>
    <p>It is important to remember that the use of specialized litter and regular care for the tray will help maintain cleanliness and comfort in the house, making your fluffy friend satisfied and happy.</p>

    <h3>Why can a cat abandon the tray</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>An unclean tray. It is very important to monitor cleanliness and replace the litter in a timely manner in order to ensure the comfort of your cat.</li>
      <li>Incorrect selection of litter. Some types of litter may not completely absorb urine, which leads to the cat's reluctance to use the tray.</li>
      <li>Incorrect placement of the tray. This place can be uncomfortable for a cat, which will make her avoid it.</li>
      <li>Competition with other cats. If another cat is already using a tray, your cat may stay away from the common toilet.</li>
      <li>Fear. Cats can be afraid to use the tray due to the presence of strangers, dogs, children, or other factors that cause stress in the house.</li>
      <li>The toilet tray is the wrong size. If the tray is inconvenient for a cat, it can refuse to use it.</li>
      <li>Insufficient number of trays. In the house where several cats live, the presence of only one tray can lead to conflicts between cats.</li>
      <li>Health problems. Diseases such as diabetes, inflammation of the bladder, kidney stones, and clogging of the urinary tract can lead to the abandonment of the tray. It is noteworthy that feeding cats with wet food instead of dry can help prevent such problems.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Understanding and eliminating these factors can contribute to the positive experience of using the tray for your cat. Regular attention to the purity, type of litter, and the general environment of a cat is crucial for maintaining its toilet habits and general well-being.</p>
    <p>To maintain cleanliness and order in the house, it is advisable to adhere to such simple rules:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Empty the tray at least twice a day.</li>
      <li>Choose a smell-free litter to maintain freshness.</li>
      <li>Follow the height of the litter layer and make sure that it is sufficient.</li>
      <li>For a cat's comfort, select a larger tray.</li>
      <li>Have a few toilet trays to prevent conflicts between cats, especially in a house where several cats live.</li>
      <li>Place the trays in a calm and quiet place where there are no extraneous sounds and movements that can disturb the cat.</li>
      <li>Consult with the vet if the cat stops using the tray, as this can be a sign of the disease.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>How often should you completely change cat litter</h3>
    <p>As you can see, how often to change a cat's litter is a very important question.  Regular change of the cat litter prevents the appearance of unpleasant odors, observes hygiene, and provides comfort for your pet. The optimal replacement frequency depends on the type of litter and the number of cats, but on average, the litter is recommended to be changed about once a week.</p>
