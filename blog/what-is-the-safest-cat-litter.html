        <h3>What is the Safest Cat Litter?</h3>
        <p>Cats are mysterious creatures. We can‚Äôt always understand what they think, and they will definitely not share their thoughts with you themselves. That is why it is important to know as much as possible about the needs of your cat in order to keep it happy and healthy as long as possible. One way to do this is to find out an answer to the question: what cat litter do vets recommend, as well as their advantages and choose the healthiest one.</p>
        <h3>Why do cats need litter?</h3>
        <p>Cats have the instinct to bury their waste, so they dig a lot in a litter tray before using it. This prevents the spread of the disease from one cat to another. If you keep cat trays clean, your cats will use them regularly - and less likely to begin to use other parts of your home as a restroom!</p>
        <h3>Why do cats bury their feces?</h3>
        <p>This is so-called instinctive behavior, which the survival of a cat in the wild mainly depends on. By doing this, cats can hide their smell from predators and protect themselves from being tracked by other animals or people. This behavior also helps them avoid predators who can smell their feces and attack them while they are vulnerable and defenseless.</p>
        <h3>Is clay litter suitable for your cat?</h3>
        <p>Clay litter is the most popular type of litter. It is inexpensive and easy to find in pet stores. It absorbs moisture well, but its use also has some disadvantages.</p>
        <p>The main drawback of clay is that it practically does not control smells. Since the clay does not stick in a humid state, as other types of litters do, all these wet particles will remain loose and track throughout the house, including where your cats spend most of their time. Moreover, clay isn‚Äôt the healthiest kitty litter, because if a person and pets inhale its tiny particles for a long time, as it can lead to breathing problems in the future. If you use clay, a closed litter tray or an automatic litter box is best suited, and it is even better to think about refusing to use clay at all.</p>
        <h3>Is paper litter suitable for your cat?</h3>
        <p>Some people prefer paper litter because it is environmentally friendly, biodegradable, and easily disposed of. Others may have problems with the smell, dust, or they can find that their cats do not like it at all.</p>
        <h3>Is silica litter suitable for your cat?</h3>
        <p>Silica is a natural mineral that absorbs smells, does not contain much dust and is believed to be hypoallergenic. It also absorbs moisture very much and will not track around the house, as other litters do. However, the use of silica litter has some disadvantages. It is not the healthiest cat litter because it‚Äôs not biodegradable, so it must be thrown into garbage. In addition, the dust from silica litter can cause breathing problems when inhaled. It is not recommended for elderly cats or those who have breathing problems, such as asthma or COPD.</p>
        <h3>Is the biodegradable litter suitable for your cat?</h3>
        <p>The biodegradable cat litter is made of materials of plant origin, such as corn or olive pits, that decompose faster than a standard clay-based litter. Since the biodegradable litter decomposes very easily, it is considered the best choice for the environment and one of the healthiest cat litter for cats. Being the healthiest cat litter to use on the market, biodegradable litter does not represent any risk to human health and safety if they are used and disposed of correctly. Biodegradable litters can be less likely to cause irritation or breathing problems in cats compared to traditional litters.</p>
        <h3>What is the safest cat litter?</h3>
        <p>You might ask yourself: what is the safest cat litter to use? The answer is biodegradable litter, because it is simply the best choice, since it is made of materials safe for cats and the environment. The biodegradable litter can be made of corn, pine, soy, wheat or olive pits. These types of litter are usually considered the most environmentally friendly option for cats and people.</p>
        <p>One of the healthiest cat litter is Paco & Pepper. It contains only organic materials without any chemicals, artificial scents or toxic elements. This guarantees that our pets will remain safe, even if they accidentally swallow it.</p>
        <p>In addition, this litter is ideal for sensitive pets and people who suffer from allergies and asthma since it does not contain dust any dust at all. Conventional litters often cause health problems due to their dusty nature, which leads to problems with different health issues. However, thanks to its dust-free formula, the Paco & Pepper cat litter prevents such problems and provides purity and freshness in the tray.</p>
