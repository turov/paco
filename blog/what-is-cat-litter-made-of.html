        <h3>What is cat litter made of</h3>
        <p>Cat owners are well aware that communication with their favorite pets can be not only pleasant but also
            demanding. Today, pet stores offer a wide range of goods designed to care for our fluffy pets. Among these
            products are various types of litters for cat toilets. So, how do you choose the most suitable product from
            various available options? Which litter is safe, and which can be harmful? Let's get acquainted with this
            issue more closely.</p>
        <h3>What is cat litter made out of</h3>
        <p>There are two main types of litters for cat toilets: absorbing and clumping. Absorbing litters effectively
            hold moisture without changing their structure due to their composition. The frequency of the tray change
            depends on the thickness of the litter layer, its quality, and the degree of humidity. To prevent the
            appearance of unpleasant odors, it is recommended to change the absorbent litter at least twice a week. When
            exposed to moisture, clumping litters form dense lumps that we can easily remove with a scoop. The cost of a
            clumping litter can be higher than that of an absorption litter. Now, let's find out what different types of
            litters for cat toilets are made of.</p>

        <h3>What is cat litter made up of: Silica Gel</h3>
        <p>The silica gel litter consists of porous granules based on silica gel, which is made of carefully dried
            polymer silica gel and has a composition similar to sand. Its outstanding absorbent properties are because
            the granules of this gel litter have a porous structure. It has the ability to absorb a volume of liquid ten
            times higher than its weight, leaving the surface dry and delaying unpleasant odors inside the granules.</p>
        <p>However, this litter can cause specific health problems, especially if the cat swallows its, which can lead
            to stomach disorders. Therefore, cats prone to this behavior are recommended to avoid this type of litter.
            Moreover, under no circumstances, these granules are to be flushed down the toilet, and the litter must be
            mixed every day since saturated granules can lead to a puddle in a tray that repels cats from using it.</p>

        <h3>What is fresh step cat litter made of: Wood litter</h3>
        <p>Wood cat litter is a more budget option. It is made of wood chips, providing natural and environmentally
            friendly qualities. This litter effectively absorbs moisture, restrains smells, and quickly disperses.
            However, its disadvantages include a significant expansion of granules when absorbing moisture, which leads
            to the rapid pollution of the tray. In addition, you will often have to change the litter because the
            granules, after absorption, turn into wet sawdust, which can stick to the pet's paws and spread around the
            house, creating an additional mess.</p>

        <h3>What is clay cat litter made of: Mineral litter</h3>
        <p>Mineral cat litter also has excellent absorbent properties and has an affordable price. However, it is dusty,
            causes irritation of the respiratory system, and makes it unsuitable for owners and pets with bronchial
            diseases, such as asthma, and allergies. Due to its structure, it can stick to animals' paws and spread
            around the house, creating a mess. In addition, it is pretty heavy, which makes transportation more
            expensive and less environmentally friendly since it requires more fuel consumption.</p>

        <h3>What is natural cat litter made of: Plant-based litter</h3>
        <p>Litters of plant origin are considered the most environmentally friendly and safe for the environment. They
            are produced from various plant materials, such as paper, corn, wood, soy, and olive pits. The main
            advantages of natural litters for cat toilets are associated with their natural composition, which is
            considered the safest for the health of pets. Made from plant materials remaining from food production, they
            are completely hypoallergenic and recommended for cats with allergies or weakened health. They are safe even
            for tiny kittens that can eat them. Plant granules, when entering the body, do not cause harm to the mucous
            membranes and completely dissolve in the digestive tract under the influence of gastric acid.</p>
        <p>Cat litters based on olive pits are also very popular. They have a high absorbent ability and effectively
            neutralize unpleasant odors. In addition, they are environmentally friendly and decompose in the soil in a
            short time. However, such litters have their drawbacks. They can attract rodents and insects and require
            regular replacement. Moreover, they can have a higher cost compared to synthetic alternatives. In general,
            the choice of litter for a cat toilet depends on the individual preferences and needs of the pet.</p>
