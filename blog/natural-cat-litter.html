        <h3>Natural Cat Litter</h3>
        <p>Most of the litters that we see in pet stores are affordable and easily accessible. Unfortunately, many of them are based on silica, which is one of the main causes of respiratory diseases, as well as a possible carcinogen. Bentonite is another substance widely used in cat litters due to its absorbent ability, but if your pet accidentally swallows it, it can cause serious harm. Clay seems to be a natural and harmless choice, but it is not amenable to biological decomposition and therefore is harmful to the environment. In addition, many litters often contain synthetic ingredients that can irritate the sensitive smell of our cats.</p>
        <h3>What is natural cat litter?</h3>
        <p>Natural cat litter is made of materials such as wood, paper, corn, wheat and even olive pits. This is a great alternative to a traditional cat litter.</p>
        <p>While clay litter can be technically ranked as natural, its extraction destroys entire ecosystems, which entails the complete destruction of the habitats of wild animals and forests. It also leads to soil erosion and, therefore, reduces the likelihood of using this land for agriculture.</p>
        <h3>What are the advantages of natural cat litter?</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Environmentally friendly
                <p>Unlike the traditional litter, which is made of non-renewable resources and forms a significant amount of waste, all-natural cat litter is biodegraded and can be composted (if you are going to compost the litter, make sure that you do it in a safe way. Get to know the normative documents of your state to dispose of home waste to avoid problems.). This reduces the amount of waste falling on landfills, and helps to preserve the resources of our planet.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                Safe for your cat
                <p>Natural kitty litter is non-toxic and does not contain harmful chemicals, which makes them a safer option for your cat. A traditional cat litter may contain scents, additives and other chemicals that can cause breathing problems and skin irritation in cats.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                Reducing mess in the house
                <p>One of the largest drawbacks of traditional litters is that they easily track throughout the house. The natural litter for cats is heavier and less likely to stick to the paws of your cat, which reduces the likelihood of a mess.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                Lack of harmful dust
                <p>A traditional litter can emit harmful particles of dust in the air that can be inhaled by both people and cats, while natural clumping cat litter does not contain dust, which makes it a safer option for your home and health of your cat's respiratory system.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                It is easier to dispose
                <p>It can be difficult to utilize the traditional litter, especially if you live in an apartment or you do not have access to the backyard. On the other hand, natural cat litter can be easily composted or thrown into garbage.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>What is best natural cat litter?</h3>
        <p>Natural litters are made from a variety of materials. Depending on various factors, such as the scent, the ability to clump, the cost, absorbing ability, etc., you can decide which one is better for your cat. Options are available from natural materials, such as corn grains, walnuts, and many others.</p>
        <h3>Wood litter.</h3>
        <p>This type of litter is made of secondary wood, such as pine or cedar. It has a high absorption ability, which makes it an excellent option for cats that urinate a lot. Its granules are light, do not cause a lot of dust, absolutely environmentally friendly, which makes them hypoallergenic. This type of litter is ideal for both adults and kittens. </p>
        <h3>Paper litter.</h3>
        <p>The paper litter is made of processed paper products, such as newspapers and cardboard. It is light, absorbing and biodegradable, which makes it environmentally friendly. A paper-based litter also does not contain dust and is harmless for your cat.</p>
        <h3>Corn litter.</h3>
        <p>Corn litter is a completely natural product in which there are no various chemical additives and components. Therefore, it is absolutely safe and hypoallergenic for cats. It is especially suitable for curious kittens that can taste it. It has a high ability to absorb a large amount of moisture, absorbing it like a sponge.</p>
        <h3>Wheat litter.</h3>
        <p>Wheat filler is made of renewable resources and is biodegradable. He absorbs moisture well and clicks well, which facilitates its cleaning. A wheat-based filler also does not contain dust and spares your cat's paws.</p>
        <h3>Olive pits.</h3>
        <p>The litter made of olive pits, which is a by-product obtained in the processing of olives, is not only safe for the health of the pet and does not contain dust but is also completely suitable for secondary processing and re-use, as it does not harm the environment.</p>
        <p>In conclusion, it is worth noting that switching to the best all-natural cat litter means that you provide a safe alternative to a traditional litter that does not contain chemicals. Natural are easy to clean, they smell perfectly and are available in a variety of options! In addition, they are environmentally friendly, safe for you and your cat, and reduce the likelihood of mess in your home.</p>
