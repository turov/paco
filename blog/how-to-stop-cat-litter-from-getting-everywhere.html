        <h3>How to stop kitty litter from getting everywhere</h3>
        <p>Cleaning up cat litter scattered throughout the house can be a frustrating task for any cat owner. However,
            there are effective strategies that can help minimize or eliminate this problem. In this article, we will
            look at various methods to prevent cat litter from getting into every corner of your apartment and maintain
            a cleaner living environment.</p>
        <h3>Understanding the Problem: Cat Litter Everywhere</h3>
        <p>How to prevent cat litter from getting everywhere? Before we dive into solutions, it's important to
            understand why cat litter ends up everywhere. Cats naturally dig into their litter boxes, which can cause
            litter particles to be scattered around. Additionally, some cats may pick up litter particles on their paws
            when exiting the litter box, further exacerbating the problem. So how to keep kitty litter from getting
            everywhere?</p>
        <h3>Ways to keep cat litter from getting everywhere</h3>
        <p>Choosing the right litter box is important to maintaining a clean and hygienic environment for both you and
            your cat. This is why choosing the right litter box is so important to keep cat litter from getting
            everywhere.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Indoor Litter Boxes: Indoor litter boxes have a lid that provides privacy for your cat and also keeps
                the litter inside the litter box. The closed design helps to trap litter particles inside, preventing
                them from spreading throughout the apartment, even when the cat digs up the litter. In addition, covered
                litter boxes help contain unpleasant odors, keeping your home smelling fresh.
            </li>
            <li>Top Entry Litter Box: Top entry litter boxes have an entrance at the top of the box rather than at the
                front. This design allows cats to enter and exit through the top, minimizing tracking and scattering of
                litter. When your cat jumps out of the box, the litter on her paws falls back into the box rather than
                onto the floor. Top-entry litter boxes are especially effective for cats that tend to actively dig or
                throw litter out of the litter box. This is a great choice to prevent kitty litter from getting
                everywhere.
            </li>
            <li>High-Walled Cat Litter Boxes: High-walled litter boxes provide an additional barrier to prevent litter
                from spreading outside of the cat's litter box. The tall sides help contain litter spillage, which is
                especially effective if your cat has a habit of scattering and digging up litter.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>By choosing a litter box with high sides, top entry, or an enclosed litter box, you can effectively keep
            kitty litter from going everywhere. When choosing a litter box, consider your cat's preferences and behavior
            so that she feels comfortable and safe when going to the toilet.</p>
        <h3>Cat litter mats</h3>
        <p>Placing mats in or near the litter box is an effective means of preventing litter from spreading throughout
            the home. Let's look at why this simple but practical solution is needed to combat litter scatter:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Captures litter particles. Mats placed in or around the litter box will trap litter particles that can
                stick to your cat's paws as they exit the litter box. The textured surface of these mats acts as a
                ‚Äútrap‚Äù to prevent the filling from getting onto the floor.
            </li>
            <li>Minimize floor clutter. By collecting trash on a rug, you can minimize the clutter in your apartment.
                Instead of allowing debris to spread freely into the corners of your home, the mat limits the spread
                area, making it easier to wash or vacuum later.
            </li>
            <li>Floor Protection: Rugs provide an extra layer of protection for your floors from scratches and damage
                caused by spilled litter. Placing a durable mat under or near the tray helps protect your hardwood
                floors, tiles, or carpeting from abrasive litter particles, preserving the appearance of your floor and
                extending its life.
            </li>
            <li>Helps Maintain Hygiene: Regular cleaning and shaking out of mats helps maintain a hygienic environment
                around the litter box. Rugs with removable covers or rugs that are made with washable materials are very
                easy to clean, which helps prevent debris and bacteria from accumulating.
            </li>
            <li>Increased aesthetic appeal. Choose designs and colors that blend seamlessly with the style of your
                interior, thereby not only creating a pleasant, clean environment in your apartment, but also
                complementing your interior with a beautiful rug.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>By properly placing mats in or around the litter box, you can effectively contain litter spills, protect the
            floor, and maintain a cleaner, more hygienic environment for both you and your cat.</p>
        <h3>Correct litter</h3>
        <p>Not all litters are equally easily scattered throughout the apartment. Usually, the particles on the outside
            are too light, flying out of the toilet when digging, or granules of cheap litter, which, upon contact with
            liquid, soak into dust and stick to the cat's paw pads. Therefore, the problem can be solved by simply
            choosing the right litter.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Clumping litter. Clumping litters form hard clumps when exposed to moisture, making cleaning easier and
                reducing traceability.
            </li>
            <li>Size and texture of granules: Choose litter with larger granules or a coarser texture, as they are less
                likely to stick to your cat's paws and track around the house. The fine-grained litter easily adheres to
                your cat's fur and is carried out of the litter box, allowing it to spread throughout the apartment.
            </li>
            <li>Low-Dust Formula: Choose a litter that produces minimal dust to reduce the number of airborne particles
                that can settle on surfaces throughout your home. Dusty litter not only creates a mess, but it can also
                pose a respiratory health hazard for both you and your cat.
            </li>
            <li>High Absorbency: Choose a highly absorbent litter to effectively retain moisture and reduce the
                incidence of wet marks on your floor.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>By carefully selecting the appropriate litter based on their clumping properties, granule size, dust levels
            and absorbency. This way, you can effectively prevent cat litter from getting everywhere and maintain a
            cleaner, more hygienic living space for you and your cat.</p>
        <p>
            By following these tips, you can significantly reduce the amount of cat litter littered throughout your
            home. Be sure to choose the right litter box and litter, and use area rugs to keep your living space clean
            and comfortable for both you and your furry friend.</p>
